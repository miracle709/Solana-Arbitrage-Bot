# Solana Arbitrage Bot

A high-performance arbitrage trading bot for Solana DEX markets, leveraging Jito bundles for fast transaction execution.

## Overview

This bot identifies and executes arbitrage opportunities across Solana decentralized exchanges by detecting price discrepancies between trading pairs. It uses circular arbitrage strategies (e.g., WSOL → USDC → WSOL) to capture profit from market inefficiencies.

**Sample Transaction**: [View on Solscan](https://solscan.io/tx/2XpqezwMdDfuttLcSWEHA8iVU1a92W36kEwcS5GFEUk8T5HK4fjaFBbFk9roh64khmsbSnDUV1ftdYSZGLqBM4CW)

## Features

- Circular arbitrage detection and execution
- Jito bundle integration for fast transaction execution
- Zero slippage configuration support
- Real-time profit calculation
- Low-latency execution monitoring


## How It Works

1. **Quote Discovery**: The bot continuously queries for circular arbitrage opportunities (WSOL → USDC → WSOL)

2. **Profit Calculation**: Compares input and output amounts to determine potential profit

3. **Threshold Check**: Only executes trades when profit exceeds a minimum threshold (currently 3000 lamports)

4. **Transaction Building**: Constructs a versioned transaction with:
   - Compute unit limits
   - Setup instructions
   - Swap instructions (both legs of the arbitrage)
   - Jito tip payment

5. **Bundle Submission**: Sends the transaction as a Jito bundle to the Frankfurt block engine for prioritized execution

6. **Monitoring**: Tracks execution time and slot information for performance analysis

## Profit Guarantee & Program Implementation

**Critical Requirement**: This bot requires an on-chain program to guarantee profitability.

### Why a Program is Needed

Even with:
- Zero slippage configuration
- Jito bundle prioritization
- Optimal route selection

You may still incur losses due to:
- Jito tip payments
- Transaction fees
- Price movements between quote and execution

### Example Transaction

See this [example transaction](https://solscan.io/tx/2XpqezwMdDfuttLcSWEHA8iVU1a92W36kEwcS5GFEUk8T5HK4fjaFBbFk9roh64khmsbSnDUV1ftdYSZGLqBM4CW) demonstrating the need for program-level profit validation:

### Program Implementation Requirements

The on-chain program should:
1. **Save initial balance** before executing swaps
2. **Calculate real profit** after all swaps complete
3. **Conditionally pay Jito tip** only if profit exceeds all costs
4. **Revert transaction** if profit is insufficient
